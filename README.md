# Atharva Raut

I'm a **Data Scientist** focused on building **practical, end-to-end data and machine learning solutions** using Python; from raw data to insights, models, and deployable applications.

I enjoy working on real-world problems where data needs to be cleaned, understood, modeled, and explained clearly to stakeholders.

## What I Do

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** & data quality assessment  
- **Machine Learning** (classification, prediction, evaluation)  
- **Feature engineering & preprocessing pipelines**  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for text data  
- **Model deployment & prototyping** using Streamlit & FastAPI

## How I Approach Problems

✔ Understand the problem  
✔ Explore & clean data  
✔ Build interpretable models  
✔ Evaluate with the right metrics  
✔ Deliver insights or deployable tools  

I prioritize **clarity, correctness, and usefulness** over unnecessary complexity.
