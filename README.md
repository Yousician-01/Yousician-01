# Hi I'm Atharva Raut

I'm a **Data Scientist** focused on building **practical, end-to-end data and machine learning solutions** using Python; from raw data to insights, models, and deployable applications.

I enjoy working on real-world problems where data needs to be cleaned, understood, modeled, and explained clearly to stakeholders.

## What I Do

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** & data quality assessment  
- **Machine Learning** (classification, prediction, evaluation)  
- **Feature engineering & preprocessing pipelines**  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for text data  
- **Model deployment & prototyping** using Streamlit & FastAPI  

---

## Tech Stack

**Languages & Tools**
- Python, C++
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn

**Data & ML**
- Feature Engineering
- Model Evaluation (Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix)
- Bias–Variance Analysis

**Visualization & Deployment**
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit
- FastAPI

**Workflow**
- Git & GitHub
- Reproducible ML pipelines
- Clean, modular code

## Featured Projects

🔹 **Automated EDA & Data Quality Analyzer**  
A Streamlit-based web application that performs automated EDA, detects missing values, outliers, constant features, and provides dataset health indicators with downloadable reports.

🔹 **Machine Learning Classification Pipelines**  
End-to-end ML workflows including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using real-world datasets.

🔹 **NLP-based Text Classification & Anomaly Detection**  
Text preprocessing, vectorization, and ML modeling for classification and anomaly detection tasks.

You can find detailed READMEs inside each repository explaining the **problem, solution, and results**.

## How I Approach Problems

1. Understand the **business or practical objective**
2. Explore and clean the data thoroughly
3. Build interpretable and reliable models
4. Evaluate results with the right metrics
5. Deliver insights or deployable prototypes

I prioritize **clarity, correctness, and usefulness** over unnecessary complexity.

## Open to Collaboration & Freelance Work

I’m open to:
- Freelance data science / ML projects
- Short-term analytical tasks
- Prototyping ML ideas into working demos

If you’re looking for someone who can **understand data and turn it into something usable**, feel free to reach out.

**Let’s connect through Upwork or GitHub**
